Came for the Kazbegi, stayed for the camaraderie of Russians. It was difficult to watch and learn about the hate towards the Russians that lives here; hate is visible in every part of the city. Graffitis, stickers, posters and everything... They ran away from their home countries to be free and support themselves,their neighbors, brothers and comrades across the border and of course, to find a new home, maybe a new shelter for themselves. I saw it in their eyes; they are truly against the war crimes that Vladimir committed, and they do not defend the ideology of a dictator. Unlike him, they are really peaceful and welcoming. I saw it in my very first days in Tbilisi. Our friend Alex(we met him there) showed us around; most of the places were for getting a booze (lol), but we learned the “real” places from him and his lovely friends. Most of the time we visited Russian places, because they only feel safest in their own spaces. Our first stop was named “Secret Place”. I immediately fell in love with this place. Unlike the cold lands where they grew up, all of them were warm, kind, and welcoming. It felt like a home that I never had and so belonged before. Girls in the kitchen who make delicious wraps and soups, boys at the bar pours the best beers and the people down the stairs who tries the makes this place even better... Everything is like a big piece of a puzzle; it makes sense when you put them all together. They are not just living here;
they are contributing culturally with workshops, meetups, and supporting the Ukrainians in need. Thats actually how I met them mostly this kind of gatherings or I approach them in the street. This place is not just a bar or a place to eat, it’s a living organism with principles. The other russian places were carrying the same warm energy just like secret place. That’s why I wanted to dedicate this selection of photographs
to people stuck in wars. These are the Russians in Tbilisi... this is “from my eyes”...
